Create an age pyramid to present the repartition of the population in your area.

3 parameters must be declared in the code:
- `agefield` : the id of the age field in your dataset
- `genderfield` : the id of the gender field in your dataset
- `valuefield` : the id of the value field in your dataset

Then, you can customize the colors of the bars in the CSS file, with the 2 variables :
- `--left-color`
- `--right-color`
